#Svelte Markdown Editor

This project is a markdown editor using Svelte, Monaco, Markdown-It, Markdown-It-Attrs, and
Markdown-It-Prism.

The saveLoad function allows the file to be save as a .md if `ctrl-s` is pressed, and as a .html if `ctrl-h` is pressed.

A markdown file can also be uploaded by pressing `ctrl-l`.

A style tag is embedded in the page that can be edited with the Style Tab.

Markdown-It-Attrs allows classes and IDs to be added to the HTML generated by the markdown.

Be careful though, because none if of the HTML is escaped.

This project requires Webpack to work properly.

\*\*\*Todo

- Make the project independent of Webpack.
- Add ability to send markdown to database api.
